# Customer Segmentation: Clustering for a Food Delivery Service  

## Overview  
This project applies clustering techniques to segment customers of a food delivery service. The goal is to identify distinct customer groups based on behavior, value, and demographics to support targeted marketing strategies.  

Developed as part of the **Master’s in Data Science and Advanced Analytics** at **NOVA IMS**, for the **Data Mining** course.  

## Methodology  
**Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, feature engineering, outlier analysis, and scaling.  
- **Clustering Approaches Explored:**  
  - DBSCAN & GMM
  - Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) 
  - K-Means
  - **Hybrid Hierarchical-K-Means** *(Final selected method)*
- **Cluster Profiling:** Analysis based on economic, demographic, and behavioral factors.
